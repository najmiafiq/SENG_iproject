    - Data Operations: Support full CRUD operations 
    - Generate sample datasets for testing and demonstration
    - Provide summary reports and statistics about the game data
    - Implement a user-friendly menu for navigation

- Deliverables:
    - C# Console Application
    - Well structured classes representing game entities
    - Sample datasets
    - LINQ Queries
    - Source code repo 


IDEAS--------------------------------
Expanding on the Fighting game, create a character sheet, with different coloured clothing for the versions(?)
Save player wins and loss, make a profile?

---------------------------STRUCTURE------------------------------------
SYSTEM FILE (separate files) - SAVE, DAMAGE CALCULATOR, PLAYER MOVEMENT(?), BASE CHARACTER INIT, UI, INTERNET, AI MOVEMENT
SAVE FILE (json) - NAME, WIN AND LOSS STAT, PICTURE/CHARACTER 
                 - (IN THE FUTURE) FAVOURITE CHARACTER, CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION

for now, read and write to a local file. Later maybe build a database to get multiplayer

Maybe we can put another file for characters? And read the characters from here? So we can get character select?
